Some random mini-projects that are large enough for me to keep around,
but not large enough to get their own separate repositories.

In reverse chronological order:

- `vbp` (2019-04-26) -- Vertical Bit-Parallelism Rank, based off of
  "BitWeaving: Fast Scans for Main Memory Data Processing"
- `scheme` (2019-01-30) -- A small Scheme (based off of
  https://scheme.cs61a.org/) that I live-coded for an "Intro to LISP"
  workshop. It's not bad for 15 minutes of live-coding, but it's quite
  incomplete.
- `threadpool` (2017-01-29) -- A `ThreadPoolExecutor` and futures
  implementation based off of Python's `concurrent.futures` module.
- `bson_parse` (2016-09-11) -- A BSON parser written wtih Rust and
  [Nom](https://github.com/geal/nom).
- `calorie-school-reproduction` (2016-07-10) -- A reproduction of a
  result I found in high school.
- `college-gender-ratio` (2016-05-17) -- Some quick plots of the gender
  ratio for different college majors. Mostly to get my feet wet with
  the [Bokeh plotting library](https://bokeh.pydata.org).
- `python-autodiff` (2015-11-27) -- Forward and reverse mode automatic
  differentiation implemented in Python in Rust. See my [blog
  post](http://www.columbia.edu/~ahd2125/post/2015/12/5/)
- `rust-autodiff` (2015-11-25) -- Simple automatic differentiation
  implemented in Rust. See my [blog
  post](http://www.columbia.edu/~ahd2125/post/2015/12/5/)
- `rust-hashmap` (2015-10-12) -- a small hashmap implemented in Rust.
- `rust-shell` (2015-09-24) -- a small shell implemented in Rust.
- `frequests` (2015-07-27) -- A small clone of
  [grequests](https://github.com/kennethreitz/grequests) but using Python's
  built-in `concurrent.futures` instead of [gevent](http://www.gevent.org/)
- `chess` (2015-06-08) -- a Jupyter notebook for my [blog post on
  permutation tests](http://www.columbia.edu/~ahd2125/post/2015/6/8/).
- `dataselect` (2014-11-19) -- an experiment to execute query strings on
  data. Motivated by frustrations with
  [Patsy](https://github.com/pydata/patsy).
- `regex` (2014-07-20) -- An attempt to construct my own regex matcher.
  Wasn't high-school me cute?
